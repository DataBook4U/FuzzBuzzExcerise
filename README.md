FuzzBuzz Coding Excerise:

This is a simple coding exercise. The created program is supposed to run in steps of one unit from a start value to an end value, both choosen by a user. If the current value looked up on can be devided by 3 the output should be Fuzz. If the current value looked up on can be devided by 5 the output should be Buzz. In case that both devisions can be done the output shall be FuzzBuzz.
